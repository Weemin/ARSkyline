<h2>🔍 Description</h2>
The goal of the project is to eventually be able to view any GitHub Skyline from their phone in augmented reality. In the future, it is possible to imagine many features such as the possibility of displaying a skyline on any flat surface, or even being able to read the GitHub pseudonym written on a surface to display the skyline on it.

The ARSkyline open source project powered by the Weemin company is therefore developed under <b>Unity 2021.3.3f1</b> in <b>C#</b>.
<h2>⚙️ Installation</h2>

Follow the steps below to be able to install ARSkyline on your phone :
